Homework Instructions  Look at the database depicted in Homework05Relation.pdf. It describes tables for Company, Shipper, Customer, Vendor, Warehouse, Product, Stored, Orders, ProductUsage, Item, and Contains. The tables are almost the same as your solution to Homework 2, except for the definition of Shipment Payment in question (h).Please also read the script Homework05Script.sql carefully. It defines and creates the sample database and has placeholders for putting in your solutions. You need to produce the queries in part 3 and put your solutions in Homework05Script.sql.For each query of Part 3,  unless stated otherwise,  a. Sort the results in ascending orderb. Remove duplicates from the answerThus, for example, assuming you are going to select a and b, you should actually use:SELECT DISTINCT a, b ... ORDER BY a ASC, b ASC;You may use intermediate tables while producing your answers. In order to run your queries without getting errors, please use TEMP1, TEMP2... as your intermediate table names. The graders will explicitly DROP them before your queries so that their old values, if any, will not create problems.After filling your solutions in Homework05Script.sql, you need then run your script on MySQL using the instructions on how to pipe the output into a file. You should name this output file Homework05Spool.txt, and you will need to hand in both this output file and your SQL script.2. Files Including in this Homework:a. This file: Homework05.pdfb. Homework05Relation.pdf, a Visio implementation of the database.c. Homework05Script.sql, a script that will produce the databse in MySQL and alsocontains placeholders to put your solutions to Part 3.
3. Queries:Produce queries for the following questions and put your answers in Homework05Script.sql.a. Produce table Answer01 (WAREHOUSENAME, PRODUCTNAMETOTAL QUANTITY) from Table ORDER, which produces possible aggregations based on subsets of {WAREHOUSENAME,PRODUCTNAME} using ROLLUP.b. Produce table Answer02 (WAREHOUSENAME, PRODUCTNAME, TOTAL QUANTITY) from Table ORDER, which produces possible aggregations based on subsets of {PRODUCTNAME, WAREHOUSENAME} using ROLLUP.c. Produce table Answer03 (PRODUCTUSAGEVALUE, PRODUCTNAME, PRODUCTID) after inserting a ProductUsage record : ProductUsageValue is 90, ProductName is XBOX and ProductID is 2651­01­2126.d. Produce table Answer05(PRODUCTNAME, PRODUCTID, PRICE, WEIGHTINLB, EIN) after deleting Product records for which ProductName is Books.e. Produce table Answer06(ITEMID, ITEMSIZE, SECONDARY) after updating an Item record : change ItemSize from 9 to 19 where ItemID is 0016.
