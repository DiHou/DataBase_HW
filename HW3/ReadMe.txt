Instructions :
Look at the database depicted in Homework03Relation.pdf. It describes tables for Company, Shipper, Customer, Vendor, Warehouse, Product, Stored, Orders, ProductUsage, Item, and Contains. The tables are almost the same as your solution to Homework 2, except for the definition of Shipment Payment in question (h).Please also read the script Homework03Script.sql carefully. It defines and creates the sample database and has placeholders for putting in your solutions. You need to produce the queries in part 3 and put your solutions in Homework03Script.sql.For each query of Part 3,  unless stated otherwise,  a. Sort the results in ascending orderb. Remove duplicates from the answerThus, for example, assuming you are going to select a and b, you should actually use:SELECT DISTINCT a, b ... ORDER BY a ASC, b ASC;You may use intermediate tables while producing your answers. In order to run your queries without getting errors, please use TEMP1, TEMP2... as your intermediate table names. The graders will explicitly DROP them before your queries so that their old values, if any, will not create problems.After filling your solutions in Homework03Script.sql, you need then run your script on MySQL using the instructions on how to pipe the output into a file. You should name this output file Homework03Spool.txt, and you will need to hand in both this output file and your SQL script.2. Files Including in this Homework:a. This file: Homework03.pdfb. Homework03Relation.pdf, a Visio implementation of the database.c. Homework03Script.sql, a script that will produce the databse in MySQL and alsoconatins placeholders to put your solutions to Part 3.

3. Queries:Produce queries for the following questions and put your answers in Homework03Script.sql.a. Produce table ANSWER01 (PRODUCTNAME, PRODUCTID) which contains all products that can not be made by VENDOR.b. Produce table ANSWER02 (EIN, NAME) which contains all companies that are not in SHIPPER, CUSTOMER and VENDOR.c. Produce table ANSWER03 (AVERAGE_PRICE) which contains the average price of the products that are heavier than 10 LB.d. Produce table ANSWER04 (CUSTOMER_NAME, CREDIT_RATING, PRODUCT_NAME) which contains all the customers and the products they ordered.e. Produce table ANSWER05 (SHIPPER_NAME, SHIPPER_EIN, PRICE_LB) that contains all SHIPPERs that have more than 2 warehouse in name decreasing order.f. Produce the table ANSWER06 (PRODUCT_1, PRODUCT_2) that contains all pair of products that i. at least one usagevalue of the first product is larger than at least one usagevalue of the second product, and ii). the price of the first product is smaller than the second product’s.g. Produce the table ANSWER07 (CUSTOMER_EIN, CUSTOMER_NAME) that contains all CUSTOMERs for whom the products they ordered include at least all the products that IBM ordered, while not including IBM itself.h. Produce the table ANSWER08 (PRODUCT_NAME, PRICE, ITEMSIZE) which contains the product whose corresponding item size is the maxnimum among all items.i. Produce the table ANSWER09 (CUSTOMER_NAME, SHIPMENT_PRICE) which contains all customer companies’ name and the total shipment price they need to pay SHIPPERS, in descending order by SHIPMENT PRICE (please carefully read the definition of shipment payment in Homework03Relation.pdf file).
